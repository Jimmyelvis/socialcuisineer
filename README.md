# The Social Cuisiener

# ![socialcuisineer](srnshts/login.jfif)

This is a very simple fictional social network project that focuses on the love of food and recipe sharing. The front end is simple HTML/CSS and some JavaScript, while the back-end is vanilla PHP, no framework. This was originally put together a few years ago. And has recently undergone a major redesign.
